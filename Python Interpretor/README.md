## Stack

Fifth is a new stack-based language. A stack is a data structure which can only have elements added to the top.
Fifth stores a stack of integers and supports commands to manipulate that stack. 
Operations always apply to the top of the stack.

Fifth supports the following arithmetic operators:

```
+ - * /
```

Each of these applies the operator to the two values on the top of the stack and pushes the
result to the top of the stack. If division results in a non-integer, round down.

Fifth also supports the following commands:

* `PUSH x` - push x onto the top of the stack, where x is a valid integer
* `POP` - remove the top element of the stack
* `SWAP` - swap the top two elements of the stack
* `DUP` - duplicate the top element of the stack

Write a python program which works as a fifth interpreter. Each line of input to the program should
represent a single fifth command. Output the result of each command to the terminal. Handle errors sensibly.

Example:
```
stack is []
PUSH 3
stack is [3]
PUSH 11
stack is [3, 11]
+
stack is [14]
DUP
stack is [14, 14]
PUSH 2
stack is [14, 14, 2]
*
stack is [14, 28]
SWAP
stack is [28, 14]
/
stack is [2]
+
